## Overview

**AI Resume Job Matcher** is a FastAPI-based backend system that parses, cleans, and prepares resumes for AI-driven job matching.  
It can extract text from **PDF** and **DOCX** resumes, clean and lemmatize content, and preserve key entities like emails, phone numbers, and URLs.

---

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**  
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **FastAPI** – for building APIs  
- **PyPDF2**, **python-docx** – for parsing PDF & DOCX files  
- **NLTK** – for text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)  
- **re (Regex)** – for entity extraction (emails, phones, URLs)  
- **Uvicorn** – ASGI server for FastAPI

## 🧹 Text Cleaning Workflow

1. **Extract text** from PDF/DOCX using `PyPDF2` or `python-docx`.  
2. **Identify and protect** key entities (emails, phone numbers, URLs).  
3. **Normalize** text: lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords, and non-alphabetic characters.  
4. **Lemmatize** words to their root forms.  
5. **Reinsert** preserved entities back into the cleaned text.  

---

## Frontend (Prototype)

The frontend interface was **prototyped using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)**, an AI-based web app builder, to quickly visualize and test the backend integration.  
Future updates may include a fully custom React or Next.js interface for enhanced flexibility and scalability.
